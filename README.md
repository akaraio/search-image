# search-image

This Streamlit app allows users to upload a folder path in the sidebar and automatically creates a database of images from that folder using Hugging Face's transformer models. The app then provides an interface for loading a pre-existing index and dataframe, which can be used to search for similar images to a chosen image uploaded by the user. Once a search is performed, the app displays the top 12 most similar images along with their corresponding paths in the main window.
